name: create-product-requirements-document
description: Load when the user asks to create, write, or generate a PRD, product requirements document, feature spec, or product brief — or says 'spec out this feature', 'write requirements for', 'plan this feature', 'document the requirements'. Should NOT load for RFCs, technical design docs, post-mortems, engineering specs without user-facing scope, or high-level roadmap items.

# Product Requirements Document Generator

Create structured Product Requirements Documents that are clear and actionable.

---
## Scope: What This Skill Covers
**In scope (use this skill):**
- Feature PRDs: user-facing functionality with acceptance criteria
- MVP scoping documents for a new product or feature area
- Product briefs where the output is consumed by engineers or an AI agent implementing the feature
**Out of scope (do not load this skill):**
- RFCs / technical design docs (architecture decisions, API contracts, infra changes with no user-facing scope)
- PRFAQs / opportunity briefs (pre-PRD discovery artifacts)
- Post-mortems, incident reports
- Epics or ticket descriptions (too narrow — those live in your issue tracker)
- Roadmap slides or executive summaries

---
## The Job
1. Receive a feature description from the user
2. Ask 3–5 clarifying questions (with lettered options)
3. Generate a structured PRD based on the answers
4. Save to `tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`

**Do NOT start implementing.** The PRD is the output; implementation is a separate step.

---
## Step 1: Clarifying Questions

Ask only when the initial prompt leaves critical decisions open. Cover:
- **Problem/Goal:** What user problem does this solve?
- **Core Functionality:** What are the key actions?
- **Scope/Boundaries:** What should it NOT do?
- **Success Criteria:** How do we measure done?
## Question Format

``` text
1. What is the primary goal of this feature?    
   A. Improve user onboarding experience
   B. Increase user retention   
   C. Reduce support burden   
   D. Other: [please specify] 
2. Who is the target user?
   A. New users only
   B. Existing users only
   C. All users   
   D. Admin users only 
3. What is the scope?    
   A. Minimal viable version   
   B. Full-featured implementation   
   C. Just the backend/API   
   D. Just the UI
```
Use the host application's preferred question UI when available. If asking in plain text, users can reply `1A, 2C, 3B` — indent the options so this reads cleanly.

## Step 2: PRD Structure
## 1. Introduction/Overview
One paragraph: the feature, the problem it solves, and who benefits.
## 2. Goals
Specific, measurable objectives (bullet list). Each goal should be verifiable at launch.
## 3. User Stories

Each story needs:

- **Title:** Short descriptive name
- **Description:** "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Verifiable checklist — each item must be falsifiable

Size each story to fit one focused implementation session.

**Format:**

``` text
### US-001: [Title] 
**Description:** As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]. 

**Acceptance Criteria:** 
- [ ] Specific verifiable criterion 
- [ ] Another criterion 
- [ ] Typecheck/lint passes
```


**Acceptance criteria must be falsifiable.** "Works correctly" is not a criterion. "Button shows confirmation dialog before deleting" is.

## 4. Functional Requirements

Numbered list of specific, unambiguous behaviors:
- `FR-1: The system must allow users to...`
- `FR-2: When a user clicks X, the system must...`
## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

Explicit list of what this feature will NOT include. Critical for managing scope creep.
## 6. Design Considerations _(optional)_
- UI/UX requirements
- Links to mockups if available
- Existing components to reuse
## 7. Technical Considerations _(optional)_
- Known constraints or dependencies
- Integration points
- Performance requirements
## 8. Success Metrics
How success will be measured post-launch:
- "Reduce time to complete X by 50%"
- "Increase conversion rate by 10%"
## 9. Open Questions
Unresolved decisions that must be answered before or during implementation.

---
## Gotchas

- **Acceptance criteria vs. implementation details.** Criteria describe observable outcomes, not how to build them. "Add `priority` column to DB" belongs in Technical Considerations or a dev story, not in user-facing acceptance criteria — unless the story is explicitly a dev/data story.
- **Non-goals prevent scope creep.** If something is likely to be requested during implementation ("can we add X too?"), preempt it in Non-Goals now.
- **One story per implementable chunk.** A story covering "add field to DB, display in UI, and add filter" is three stories. Split it.
- **Output path is a default, not a rule.** The default save location is `tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`. If the project uses a different convention (e.g., `docs/`, `specs/`), match it.
- **Metrics must be measurable.** "Users are happy" is not a metric. Tie success metrics to observable signals: time, click count, error rate, conversion rate.

## Output
- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Default location:** `tasks/`
- **Filename:** `prd-[feature-name].md` (kebab-case)

## Example PRD
See `references/example-prd.md` for a complete worked example (Task Priority System) demonstrating the structure, story sizing, and acceptance-criteria style above. Read it on first use or when you need a concrete reference for shape and depth.

## Pre-Save Checklist
- Asked clarifying questions with lettered options
- Incorporated user's answers
- Each user story is small enough for one implementation session
- Acceptance criteria are falsifiable (not vague)
- Non-goals section defines clear boundaries
- Success metrics are measurable
